# CHESS-BOARDz
WebGL Chess Board.
<BR>
Work in progress, does not play actual game yet - http://www.userspace.org/chessworld/

DESIGN GUIDELINES:<BR>
 *Using different materials for each piece and designating its name in it.<BR>
  Did not use the mesh since it coud be multiple and animate in the DAE.<BR>
  *Using indivdual squares for board that can be sleected.<BR>
 *Each model is a one piece mesh. Not multiple. Made and exported in Blender. <BR>
  *On top of using WebGL I want to use latest HTML5 and CSS3 elements.<BR>
  *Want to keep basic colors and not textures for now. If a texture is used<BR>
 convert it into a CSS element, so it can be trafered easily with script. <BR>
 *Keep this version of the game classical, any marjor <BR>
 variations can be forked off.<BR>
